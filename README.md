# Analyze and Process OpenStreetMap data with F#

F# is ~~a~~ the perfect programming language for OSM data analysis and processing. I use it since many years - in combination with C# for low level pointer access to memory.

For instance accessing the data inside a memory mapped FlatMap file feels like accessing the data with the convenience of the nicest declarative database languages (is there a nice one?) with the endless advantage of a modern pragmatic programming language.

The scripts in this repo demonstrate the way you can work with F# and OSM data. If you do similar things with other languages, Python, Java, Go or C++ and maybe databases - lets compare execution times and code samples.

If you are interested in more about F# and OSM data please star this repo, leave comments in the wiki, discussions.
